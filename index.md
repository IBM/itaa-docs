IBM IT Architect Assistant is a modeling and authoring tool designed to assist IT Architects to collaboratively create solution architectures. It currently is available as a hosted SasS offering on IBM Cloud and also available in a single-user Community Edition.

This repository provides the end-user documentation for each of these offerings. To get started, see:

    Full collaborative IBM IT Architect Assistant
    SIngle-User IBM IT Architect Assistant, Community Edition
        What's new with v3.0 - Misc Diagrams that allow "sketching" as well as importing of Draw.io diagrams. Associated with this is the ability to render a Misc Diagram as an architecture diagram (you choose) and then be able to selectively convert drawing elements (annotations) to be architectural elements.

You can post issues to this repository for either offering of IBM IT Architect Assistant!
