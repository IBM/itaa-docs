IBM IT Architect Assistant is a modeling and authoring tool designed to assist IT Architects to collaboratively create solution architectures. It currently is available as a hosted SasS offering on IBM Cloud (see [IBM Marketplace](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/architect-assistant?mhsrc=ibmsearch_p&mhq=IT%20Architect%20Assistant)) and also available in a single-user [Community Edition](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/edit/architect-assistant).



This repository provides the end-user documentation for each of these offerings.  To get started, see:

- Full collaborative [IBM IT Architect Assistant](./docs/enterprise/Overview-ITAA.md)
- SIngle-User [IBM IT Architect Assistant, Community Edition](./docs/community-edition/Overview-ITAA-CE.md) , v3.0 (released on Oct 2, 2020)
  - **What's new with v3.0** - **Misc Diagrams** that allow "sketching" as well as **importing of Draw.io** diagrams.  Associated with this is the ability to render a Misc Diagram as an architecture diagram (you choose) and then be able to selectively **convert drawing elements** (annotations) to be architectural elements.



You can post issues to this repository for either offering of IBM IT Architect Assistant!
