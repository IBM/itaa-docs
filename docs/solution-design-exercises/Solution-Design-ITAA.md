# Solution Design on IBM IT Architect Assistant



This is an introduction to a set of self-paced exercises to introduce one to both Solution Design / Solution modeling and IBM IT Architect Assistant. The primary intent is to focus on the tool usage.

##Case Study

The exercises focus on the case study described below:

*MyBank, based in St. Louis, are having big problems in their Retail Division with customer service and have asked to expand on the current solution. They have started down the road of a multi-channel customer experience. They integrated their existing mainframe-based systems so that CSRs can see all information about a customer's accounts and are allowing customers to access this info from the Internet. However, they are now having issues with supporting various campaigns from both a customer segmenting perspective and a bank staffing perspective. They want to expand the current functionality into an on-demand contact center implementation.*
